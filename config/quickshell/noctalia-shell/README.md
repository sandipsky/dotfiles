## 🖥️ Wayland Compositors

Noctalia provides native support for **Niri**, **Hyprland**, **Sway**, **Scroll**, **Labwc** and **MangoWC**. Other Wayland compositors may work but could require additional configuration for compositor-specific features like workspaces and window management.

---

## Scope

Noctalia is a **desktop shell**, not a full desktop environment. It provides the visual layer that sits on top of your Wayland compositor (bars, panels, notifications, a dock, and widgets) but it intentionally stays within that boundary. Understanding this helps set the right expectations for feature requests.

### What Noctalia does

Noctalia focuses on the things a shell is responsible for: status bar, panels, application launcher, notifications, lock screen, idle management, OSD, theming, wallpapers, desktop widgets, dock, and multi-monitor support.

### What belongs in a plugin

If a feature is useful to some users but not essential to the core shell experience, it's a great candidate for a [plugin](https://noctalia.dev/plugins/). The plugin system is designed to make this easy: plugins can add bar widgets, panels, launcher providers, desktop widgets, and more.

Some examples of features that are better suited as plugins:
- Compositor-specific extras (e.g., Steam overlay for Hyprland)
- Hardware-specific controls (e.g., laptop fan profiles, battery thresholds)
- Third-party service integrations (e.g., smart home controls, Tailscale)
- Niche productivity tools (e.g., Pomodoro timer, RSS reader, Docker manager)
- Alternative visualizations or widgets

If you have an idea that fits this category, consider [building a plugin](https://docs.noctalia.dev/development/guideline) for it!

### What falls outside our scope

Some features go beyond what a desktop shell can or should do. These are typically responsibilities of the compositor, a dedicated application, or the system itself:

- **File management**: use a file manager application
- **Display/login greeter**: this runs before the shell and is managed separately
- **Window management and overview**: workspace switching and window tiling are compositor responsibilities
- **Removable drive mounting**: handled by system services like udisks and desktop applications
- **Screen mirroring/casting**: managed by the compositor or dedicated tools

We appreciate feature suggestions, but if a request falls into this category, it's likely outside what Noctalia can provide. When in doubt, feel free to ask in our [Discord](https://discord.noctalia.dev).
